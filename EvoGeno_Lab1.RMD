```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Exercise 1 

```{r ex1}
x <- 3
y <- 15
#sum
x+y
#difference
y-x
#product
x*y
#quotient
y/x
```

### Exercise 2

```{r ex2}
#Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
x <- 2
y <- 3
x^5 > y^4 


```

### Exercise 3

```{r ex3}
vec<-c(22,62,148,43,129)
#Determine the sum of the vector
a<-sum(vec)
#Divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine 
vec/a

```

### Exercise 4

```{r ex4}
#Sort the vector
nuc<- "A,T,C,G"
sort(nuc)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
